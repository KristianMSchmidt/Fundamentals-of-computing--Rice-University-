question 5:

mean = 51,7
deviation = 7,11
real_score = 875
z_score = 116,8


Based on your answers to Questions 4 and 5, is the score resulting from the local alignment of the HumanEyelessProtein
and the FruitflyEyelessProtein due to chance? NOO!!!!! IT IS EXXXTREMELY UNLIKELY. As a concrete question, which is more likely: the similarity between the 
human eyeless protein and the fruitfly eyeless protein being due to chance or winning the jackpot in an extremely large lottery? Provide a short explanation for your answers
